- 👋 Hi, I’m @rafosos! I'm a 19 years old brazilian guy who likes to program, and my goal right now is to study programming and make it my carrer.
- 👀 I’m interested in games, music and movies, and regarding to proggraming I'm interested in back-end, game development and mobile.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css and javascript (I know, quite the opposite of what I just said), but I plan on studying more back-end stuff soon!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project who is willing to teach me, since I'm currently a noob begginner.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can email me: rafael.lrfrancisco@gmail.com, or follow me and send a DM on my Instagram: @rafaeldemaria_
